README




Welcome in our code. 

As you can see some methods have been added to the code :
        
- The method "contains" aims to search an int[] into an ArrayList of int[]
- We coded the method "connectedPixels" in a different way that the one proposed in the notice. Our algorithm take the minutia and get his neighbours, and then we get the neighbours of the previous neighbours until we don't find any more new neighbours.
- Several test methods  have been added (main.java) including commented test (Fingerprint.java) to check the output of each method.
